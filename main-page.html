              In this project, I worked with a team to design an application for
              a password manager. I was team leader, and was personally
              responsible for the ideas and design of the overall application,
              and specifically the home page. This project was a great
              experience in teamwork and leadership, and I learned a lot about
              application design, and I also recieved a 1st class mark.

              This was my first attempt at both using JavaScript, and creating a
              game. I created a simple cookie clicker clone, which allowed me to
              learn the basics of JavaScript, and how to create a simple game.
              While it isn't complex nor perfect, it was a great learning
              experience, and I am proud of what it is.

              This was a slightly more complex project, where I created a simple
              to-do application using JavaScript. It had a slightly more complex
              scope, I had to learn how to use JavaScript to create HTML
              elements dynamically. Through this project, I learned some of
              JavaScript's vulnerabilities, and how to work around them, such as
              the risks of innerHTML. I also used this project to learn about
              APIs, I added a feature to take the user's location, and display
              the weather using the OpenWeatherAPI. This was a great project to
              learn more about JavaScript, and how to use APIs, and I am proud
              of the result.
