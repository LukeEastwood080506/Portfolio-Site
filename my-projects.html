          Project 1: University Project - Itinerary Manager
          <div class="icons8-java"></div>
        </h2>
        <p>This project was made for my first larger University assignment.</p>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a Java application using the Swing framework,
          for a hypothetical activity management company.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first real experience with Java and Swing, before this I
          had only used Java for smaller assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The criteria for the project had four phases, each with its own
          requirements. Each phase added more functionality to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phases one through three were developed as purely console based
          interactions, this takes the user through a series of inputs and
          options to manage their itinerary. At the end it then saves this
          itinerary to a file using a specific format, this file can then be
          loaded back into the application. The fourth phase was to create a GUI
          using the Swing framework, this was a challenge for me as I had never
          used Swing outside of practice, small tasks before. The GUI only had
          to be a very simple interface, it just had to show the itineraries,
          and allow the user to double click an itinerary for further
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          Java and Swing. Since it is a University project, I cannot share the
          code publicly, but I can share the results from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I recieved 70%, which when combined with the first
          assessment for the module, gave me a final mark of 75% for the module,
          which is a 1st class grade.

        <p>
          This project was made for my second University assignment, which was
          focused on SQL and database management.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was my first time ever using SQL, and writing queries to
          a database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a 'portfolio' of SQL queries related to a
          specified database, to improve our knowledge on how SQL and it's
          specific features work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I used SQL Server, alongside the SQL Server
          Management Studio (SSMS) to write and test my queries. Outside of the
          project, I also practiced using the online platform LeetCode, which
          has a section dedicated to SQL queries, for this I decided to use
          MySQL, to broaden my knowledge some more.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I wrote over 40 queries, covering a wide variety of
          topics, such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, and functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          SQL and how to write queries. Since it is a University project. The
          queries can be found in the GitHub repository.

        </h2>
        <p>
          This project was made for my third University assignment, which was a
          team-based project focused on systems and app design/planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was my first time ever working in a team on a project,
          and it was a great learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the team leader for this project, and I was responsible for
          coordinating the team and ensuring that we met our deadlines. I also
          took on the role of the design for the overall system, and
          specifically the home page of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we had to plan out and design the app idea,
          functionality, and the way the app would work using a variety of
          diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          systems design and how to work in a team. Since it is a University
          project, I cannot share the entire document publicly, but I can share
          some screenshots with some information redacted, as well as the
          results from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I received 83%, which is a 1st class grade. 25% of
          the mark was for the group work, and 75% was for the individual work.
