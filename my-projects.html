          Project 1: University Project - Itinerary Manager
          <div class="icons8-java"></div>
        </h2>
        <p>This project was made for my first larger University assignment.</p>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a Java application using the Swing framework,
          for a hypothetical activity management company.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first real experience with Java and Swing, before this I
          had only used Java for smaller assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The criteria for the project had four phases, each with its own
          requirements. Each phase added more functionality to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phases one through three were developed as purely console based
          interactions, this takes the user through a series of inputs and
          options to manage their itinerary. At the end it then saves this
          itinerary to a file using a specific format, this file can then be
          loaded back into the application. The fourth phase was to create a GUI
          using the Swing framework, this was a challenge for me as I had never
          used Swing outside of practice, small tasks before. The GUI only had
          to be a very simple interface, it just had to show the itineraries,
          and allow the user to double click an itinerary for further
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          Java and Swing. Since it is a University project, I cannot share the
          code publicly, but I can share the results from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I recieved 70%, which when combined with the first
          assessment for the module, gave me a final mark of 75% for the module,
          which is a 1st class grade.

          This project was made for my second University assignment, which was
          focused on SQL and database management.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was my first time ever using SQL, and writing queries to
          a database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a 'portfolio' of SQL queries related to a
          specified database, to improve our knowledge on how SQL and it's
          specific features work.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I used SQL Server, alongside the SQL Server
          Management Studio (SSMS) to write and test my queries. Outside of the
          project, I also practiced using the online platform LeetCode, which
          has a section dedicated to SQL queries, for this I decided to use
          MySQL, to broaden my knowledge some more.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I wrote over 40 queries, covering a wide variety of
          topics, such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, and functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          SQL and how to write queries. Since it is a University project. The
          queries can be found in the GitHub repository.

        <p>
          This project was made for my third University assignment, which was a
          team-based project focused on systems and app design/planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was my first time ever working in a team on a project,
          and it was a great learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the team leader for this project, and I was responsible for
          coordinating the team and ensuring that we met our deadlines. I also
          took on the role of the design for the overall system, and
          specifically the home page of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we had to plan out and design the app idea,
          functionality, and the way the app would work using a variety of
          diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about
          systems design and how to work in a team. Since it is a University
          project, I cannot share the entire document publicly, but I can share
          some screenshots with some information redacted, as well as the
          results from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, I received 83%, which is a 1st class grade. 25% of
          the mark was for the group work, and 75% was for the individual work.

          This project was my first attempt at creating both something with
          JavaScript, as well as anything that resembled a game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt it was a good introduction into the world of JS, and how I
          could use it to enhance simple HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt the scope could be kept small enough that I could still have a
          finished product, and it would teach me some key parts of JS, but it
          also wouldn't feel overwhelming and eat up my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I had never used JS, and it was really my second attempt at HTML
          and CSS, it's still very rough, and definitely is not something I'd
          consider perfect, but I'm pleased with the effort I made towards
          creating something.

        <p>
          This project was my first attempt at making some kind of "web app"
          using JS. I wanted a simple app that would still stretch my knowledge
          somewhat, so I decided on creating a basic project, a to-do
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project would teach me how to dynamically create DOM elements
          with JavaScript, which is something I really I didn't know when I was
          creating my Cookie Clicker Clone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used my previous knowledge in using LocalStorage to save the tasks
          created and had to understand further how this JSON actually worked to
          be able to write my own loading function, it took some effort to work
          out, but I am pleased with how it came out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application allows the user to add tasks, tick them off, and
          remove them, as well as completely clear the tasks at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a challenge, once I'd finished the main functionality, I wanted to
          try and add some form of API usage, therefore I also added a simple
          weather indicator to the top, this takes the users location, and uses
          the langitude and longitude to ping the OpenWeather API for the users
          current weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can't be seen on the site as it requires an API key, however
          screenshots below and a showcase in the repo show this working, as
          well as just adding an API key to the source code, would allow you to
          see for yourself.
